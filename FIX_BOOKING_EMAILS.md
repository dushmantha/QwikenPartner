# Fix Booking Email Delivery

I found and fixed the issues preventing booking confirmation emails from being sent. Here are the problems and solutions:

## Issues Found:

1. **‚úÖ FIXED: Email code was unreachable** - The email sending code was placed after a `return` statement, so it never executed
2. **‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS SETUP: Email service not configured** - The RESEND_API_KEY is set to a placeholder value

## Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed Email Execution Order
**File:** `src/services/api/bookings/bookingsAPI.ts`
- **Problem:** Email sending code was after `return` statement (lines 142-148)
- **Fix:** Moved email code before the return statement
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Email code now executes when booking is created

## Setup Required:

### 2. Configure Email Service (Resend)

The app uses [Resend](https://resend.com) for sending emails. You need to:

1. **Create Resend Account**:
   - Go to https://resend.com
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Verify your email address

2. **Get API Key**:
   - Go to https://resend.com/api-keys
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Give it a name like "Qwiken Booking Emails"
   - Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

3. **Set Up Domain (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - Go to https://resend.com/domains
   - Add your domain (e.g., `qwiken.com`)
   - Add the DNS records they provide
   - Verify the domain

### 3. Configure Supabase Secrets

You need to set the RESEND_API_KEY in Supabase secrets:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**:
   - https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fezdmxvqurczeqmqvgzm

2. **Navigate to Edge Functions**:
   - Click "Edge Functions" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Manage secrets"

3. **Add the Secret**:
   - Click "New secret"
   - Name: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your actual Resend API key (e.g., `re_abcd1234...`)
   - Click "Save"

4. **Deploy Functions** (if needed):
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions deploy send-email
   ```

## Testing the Fix:

1. **Create a test booking** in the app
2. **Check console logs** - you should see:
   ```
   üìß Sending booking confirmation email: user@example.com
   ‚úÖ Email sent successfully via Resend: [message-id]
   ```

3. **Check email** - Customer should receive booking confirmation

## Email Content Includes:

‚úÖ **Booking Details**: Service, date, time, duration, price
‚úÖ **Shop Information**: Name, address, phone
‚úÖ **Staff Information**: Assigned staff member (if applicable)  
‚úÖ **Customer Information**: Name, phone, email
‚úÖ **Cancellation Policy**: Instructions for changes
‚úÖ **Professional Formatting**: HTML email template

## Alternative: Use Development Mode

If you don't want to set up Resend immediately, the edge function has a fallback:

- **Without RESEND_API_KEY**: Returns mock success, logs email details
- **Booking still succeeds**: Email failure doesn't block bookings
- **Console shows**: "Email sent (development mode)"

## Email Service Features:

‚úÖ **Booking Confirmation**: Sent immediately after booking
‚úÖ **Professional Templates**: HTML formatted emails
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Booking succeeds even if email fails
‚úÖ **Logging**: All emails logged in database for tracking
‚úÖ **Multiple Recipients**: Supports customer and business notifications

The core issue was that the email code never executed due to improper placement. Now it will work properly once you configure the Resend API key!
