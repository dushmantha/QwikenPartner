console.log('üéØ Loading State Coordination Fix Applied\n');

console.log('üîç Root Cause Found:');
console.log('The loading screen issue was caused by conflicting loading states:');
console.log('1. loadUserProfile() sets isLoading = true');
console.log('2. initializeAccountType() also sets isLoading = true'); 
console.log('3. Profile loading completes and tries to set isLoading = false');
console.log('4. But account type initialization is still running');
console.log('5. Account type eventually completes but loading stays visible');
console.log('6. Result: User sees infinite loading screen\n');

console.log('‚úÖ Coordination Fix Applied:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Combined both functions into a single coordinated initialization');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Single setIsLoading(true) at start of both processes');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Use Promise.all() to wait for both functions to complete');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Single setIsLoading(false) only after both are done');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Eliminated race conditions between the two loading states\n');

console.log('üì± Expected Behavior Now:');
console.log('1. Login triggers single loading state');
console.log('2. Both profile and account type load simultaneously');
console.log('3. Loading cleared only when BOTH complete');
console.log('4. No more conflicts between different loading states');
console.log('5. Smooth transition to main app (no stuck loading)\n');

console.log('üß™ Watch for These New Logs:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ "‚úÖ Both account type and profile initialization completed"');
console.log('‚Ä¢ "‚úÖ Profile loading completed" (without setting isLoading)');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Should see fewer "AccountSwitchLoader" messages');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Single loading period instead of multiple loading cycles\n');

console.log('üéØ Performance Improvement:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Eliminated loading state conflicts');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Faster loading with parallel execution');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Single loading period instead of multiple cycles');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Better user experience with coordinated state management\n');

console.log('üìù Technical Details:');
console.log('Before: loadUserProfile() and initializeAccountType() ran independently');
console.log('After: Both functions coordinated with Promise.all() and shared loading state');
console.log('\n‚ú® Try logging out and back in - should load smoothly without getting stuck!');
