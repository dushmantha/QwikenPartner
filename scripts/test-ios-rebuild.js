console.log('cd ..');
console.log('npx react-native run-ios\n');

console.log('📋 Current status:');
console.log('✅ AppDelegate.swift has been updated with token forwarding');
console.log('✅ React Native push service is enhanced with debugging');
console.log('✅ Supabase edge function is working');
console.log('✅ Push notification permissions are granted');

console.log('🎯 After rebuilding:');
console.log('- Device tokens will be generated by native iOS');
console.log('- Tokens will be forwarded to React Native automatically');
console.log('- Tokens will be saved to Supabase database');
console.log('- Push notifications will show "sent: 1" instead of "sent: 0"');
console.log('- You will receive notifications on your device\n');
