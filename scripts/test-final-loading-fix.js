console.log('🎯 Final Loading Screen Fix - Re-initialization Prevention\n');

console.log('🔍 Additional Issue Found:');
console.log('Even though coordinated initialization was completing successfully,');
console.log('the loading screen was still showing because:');
console.log('');
console.log('1. ✅ Both initializations complete successfully');
console.log('2. ✅ setIsLoading(false) called correctly');
console.log('3. ❌ But useEffect re-triggers immediately due to user object changes');
console.log('4. ❌ App state changes (background/foreground) cause user refreshes');
console.log('5. ❌ This creates an infinite re-initialization loop');
console.log('6. ❌ Loading screen never clears because of constant re-triggers\n');

console.log('✅ Final Fix Applied:');
console.log('• Added isInitializing state to prevent re-initialization loops');
console.log('• Added guard: if (isInitializing) return - skips duplicate calls');
console.log('• Added initialization progress logging');
console.log('• Updated useEffect dependencies to respect initialization state');
console.log('• Clear logging: "isLoading set to false" when actually completed\n');

console.log('📱 Expected Behavior Now:');
console.log('1. Login triggers single initialization cycle');
console.log('2. Prevents re-initialization during app state changes');
console.log('3. Clear completion message with isLoading confirmation');
console.log('4. Loading screen clears immediately after completion');
console.log('5. No more infinite loops or stuck loading states\n');

console.log('🧪 Watch for These Key Logs:');
console.log('✅ "🔄 Starting coordinated initialization..."');
console.log('✅ "✅ Both account type and profile initialization completed - isLoading set to false"');
console.log('⏭️ "⏭️ Initialization already in progress, skipping" (prevents duplicates)');
console.log('❌ Should NOT see multiple "AccountSwitchLoader" after completion\n');

console.log('🎯 This Should Fix:');
console.log('• ✅ Infinite loading screens after login');
console.log('• ✅ Re-initialization loops on app state changes');
console.log('• ✅ Loading state not clearing properly');
console.log('• ✅ Multiple initialization cycles');
console.log('• ✅ App going background/foreground triggering re-loads\n');

console.log('🚀 Performance Improvements:');
console.log('• Single initialization cycle per login');
console.log('• Prevents unnecessary re-initialization on app state changes');
console.log('• Faster loading with proper state coordination');
console.log('• Eliminates infinite loops and resource waste\n');

console.log('🔬 Technical Fix Summary:');
console.log('Before: useEffect re-triggered on every user/auth change → infinite loops');
console.log('After: isInitializing guard prevents re-triggers → single clean initialization');
console.log('\n✨ Try logging out and back in - should load once and stay loaded!');
