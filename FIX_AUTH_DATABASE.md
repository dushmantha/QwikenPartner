# Fix Supabase Authentication Database Issue

The "Database error saving new user" issue is caused by problematic database triggers. Here's how to fix it:

## Solution 1: Run the Database Fix Script (Recommended)

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fezdmxvqurczeqmqvgzm

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New query"

3. **Run the Fix Script**
   - Copy the entire contents of `supabase/fix_database_auth.sql`
   - Paste into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run"
   - Wait for "Auth database fix completed successfully!" message

## Solution 2: Simple Fix (If Solution 1 Fails)

If you get permission errors, try the simpler version:

1. **In SQL Editor, run:**
   - Copy contents of `supabase/fix_auth_simple.sql`
   - Paste and run
   - Look for "Simple auth fix applied!" message

## What the Fix Does

1. **Removes problematic triggers** that cause database errors
2. **Creates a simple profiles table** for user data
3. **Sets up safe triggers** that never fail
4. **Configures proper permissions** for auth operations
5. **Tests the fix** to ensure it works

## After Running the Fix

1. **Test registration immediately:**
   ```bash
   node testSupabaseAuth.js
   ```

2. **Expected result:**
   ```
   ✅ Basic signup successful!
   User ID: [some-uuid]
   ```

3. **Test in your app:**
   - Try registering a new user
   - Should work without "Database error saving new user"

## Alternative: Manual Database Check

If you want to see what's causing the issue first:

```sql
-- Check for problematic triggers
SELECT 
    t.tgname as trigger_name,
    p.proname as function_name
FROM pg_trigger t
JOIN pg_class c ON c.oid = t.tgrelid
JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
JOIN pg_proc p ON p.oid = t.tgfoid
WHERE n.nspname = 'auth' AND c.relname = 'users';
```

## If Problems Persist

1. **Check the console logs** in SQL Editor for any error messages
2. **Try running each section** of the fix script separately
3. **Contact me** with the specific error messages you see

## Important Notes

- ✅ This fix keeps your existing Supabase project
- ✅ No data loss - only fixes broken triggers
- ✅ Works with your current auth configuration
- ✅ Maintains security with RLS policies
- ✅ Creates proper user profiles table

The database trigger was likely created incorrectly or got corrupted during a migration. This fix creates a clean, working auth system that won't fail during user registration.
